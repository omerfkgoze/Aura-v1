# Epic 3: Stealth Mode & Adaptive UI

**Epic Goal:** Create privacy-adaptive interface with stealth mode capabilities, duress protection, and uncertainty visualization that enables discrete menstrual tracking while providing accessible and internationalized user experience with clear prediction explanations.

## Story 3.1: Stealth Mode Interface Implementation

As a user requiring discrete menstrual tracking,
I want the app to disguise itself as a calculator or notes application with secure mode switching,
so that I can track my cycle without revealing the app's true purpose to observers.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. Calculator disguise mode with fully functional calculator interface hiding tracking features
2. Notes app disguise mode with genuine note-taking capability masking health tracking
3. Secure mode switching via specific gesture sequences or biometric authentication
4. Stealth mode persistence surviving app restarts and background/foreground cycles
5. Visual design consistency ensuring disguise modes appear as legitimate utility apps
6. Quick-exit functionality immediately switching to disguise when interrupted
7. Stealth mode testing validating complete UI transformation without revealing traces

## Story 3.2: Duress Protection and Security Features

As a user in a potentially compromising situation,
I want duress PIN functionality and neutral notifications that protect my privacy,
so that my menstrual tracking remains hidden even under coercion or surveillance.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. Duress PIN system providing alternate authentication that hides or wipes sensitive data
2. Neutral notification system with time-shifting to avoid revealing cycle-related patterns
3. Decoy data functionality showing false information when accessed under duress
4. Panic button feature for immediate data wipe or mode switching in emergency situations
5. Notification scheduling randomization preventing pattern analysis by observers
6. Session timeout with automatic stealth mode activation during extended idle periods
7. Duress protection testing ensuring complete data protection under simulated coercion

## Story 3.3: Uncertainty Visualization Framework

As a user interpreting cycle predictions,
I want visual uncertainty bands with clear explanations of prediction confidence,
so that I understand the reliability of predictions and can make informed decisions.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. Probability distribution visualization showing likelihood ranges for cycle events
2. Confidence interval display with color-coded uncertainty levels (high, medium, low)
3. Historical accuracy overlay comparing past predictions with actual events
4. Interactive timeline allowing users to explore different prediction scenarios
5. Uncertainty trend analysis showing how prediction confidence changes over time
6. Visual calibration metrics helping users understand their personal prediction patterns
7. Uncertainty communication testing ensuring users correctly interpret probability information

## Story 3.4: On-Device Prediction Explanation System

As a user wanting to understand my cycle patterns,
I want detailed explanations of why predictions have specific confidence levels,
so that I can understand the factors affecting my cycle and improve tracking accuracy.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. Factor analysis explaining contributors to prediction confidence (regularity, data completeness)
2. "What-if" scenario modeling showing how different inputs affect predictions
3. Cycle pattern recognition highlighting detected trends and anomalies in user data
4. Personalized insights generated entirely on-device without external data sharing
5. Explanation clarity testing ensuring users understand factor importance and impact
6. Sensitivity analysis showing which data points most influence prediction accuracy
7. Educational content helping users understand menstrual cycle variability and factors

## Story 3.5: Accessibility and Internationalization Foundation

As a diverse user requiring accessible and localized experience,
I want WCAG AA compliance and RTL language support with screen reader compatibility,
so that I can use the app regardless of my abilities or preferred language.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. WCAG AA compliance across all interfaces including stealth modes
2. Screen reader compatibility with discrete audio descriptions maintaining privacy
3. High contrast mode support preserving stealth mode effectiveness
4. RTL language support foundation with Arabic/Hebrew layout testing
5. Keyboard navigation support for all interactive elements and mode switching
6. Voice control compatibility with privacy-preserving voice command recognition
7. Accessibility testing with assistive technology validation ensuring usable experience
