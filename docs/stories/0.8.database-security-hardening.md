## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context

This story implements comprehensive database security hardening as specified in [Source: architecture/security-and-performance.md] security requirements and builds upon the zero-knowledge architecture principles established in [Source: architecture/data-models.md] to ensure complete user data isolation through Row Level Security policies.

### Previous Story Insights

From Story 0.7 completion (Comprehensive Threat Model Creation):

- **Critical Database Threats Identified**: 4 Critical threats (400+ risk score) directly related to database security require mitigation
- **Zero-Knowledge Architecture Validation**: Threat model confirms that proper RLS implementation mitigates most critical server-side data access threats
- **User Isolation Requirements**: Cross-user data access prevention identified as highest priority security control
- **Regulatory Compliance Framework**: GDPR, HIPAA compliance requires auditable database access controls with policy violation detection

Key Insights from Threat Model:

- Family Member Device Access (Risk Score: 450) requires device-level authentication but database isolation prevents server-side cross-user access
- State Reproductive Health Investigations (Risk Score: 450) mitigated by zero-knowledge architecture with proper RLS policies
- Database compromise scenarios require defense-in-depth with encryption at rest, RLS policies, and audit logging
- Server breach attack trees identified privilege escalation through RLS policy bypass as critical vulnerability

### Data Models and RLS Requirements [Source: architecture/data-models.md]

**User Data Isolation Architecture:**

All database tables implement user isolation through RLS policies using `auth.uid()`:

**EncryptedUserPrefs Table:**

- RLS Policy: `userId = auth.uid()` - users can only access their own preferences
- Service Role Restriction: Explicitly limited to schema metadata, migration tracking, health checks, and system monitoring. Completely prohibited from accessing encrypted payloads, user data, or authentication information

**EncryptedCycleData Table:**

- RLS Policy: `userId = auth.uid()` - complete user data isolation
- Version Control: Optimistic concurrency prevents data corruption
- Sync Status: Device-specific tracking without cross-user exposure

**HealthcareShare Table:**

- RLS Policy: `userId = auth.uid()` - sharing creator control only
- Token-based Access: Separate ShareToken table with token-based RLS
- Audit Integration: All access attempts logged without PII exposure

**DeviceKey Table:**

- RLS Policy: `userId = auth.uid()` - device key isolation per user
- Key Rotation: Automated rotation without cross-user key exposure
- Device Management: Hash-based device identification for privacy

**ShareToken Table (Separate RLS):**

- RLS Policy: `token = supplied_token AND expiresAt > NOW()` - token-based access only
- No User Reference: Prevents user enumeration through token validation
- Time-based Expiration: Automatic access revocation

### Database Security Configuration [Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md]

**Supabase Connection Security:**

Connection string requirements:

```
postgresql://postgres:[password]@[host]:5432/postgres?sslmode=require&sslcert=client-cert.pem&sslkey=client-key.pem&sslrootcert=ca-cert.pem
```

**Repository Pattern with RLS Enforcement:**

```typescript
class CycleDataRepository {
  async updateWithOptimisticConcurrency(
    recordId: string,
    encryptedPayload: string,
    cryptoEnvelope: CryptoEnvelope,
    currentVersion: number,
    deviceIdHash: string
  ): Promise<UpdateResult> {
    // All operations automatically enforce RLS through auth.uid()
    const { data, error } = await this.supabase.rpc('update_cycle_data_optimistic', {
      record_id: recordId,
      new_payload: encryptedPayload,
      new_envelope: cryptoEnvelope,
      current_version: currentVersion,
      device_hash: deviceIdHash,
    });
  }
}
```
