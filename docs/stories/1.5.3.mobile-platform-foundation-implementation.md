# Story 1.5.3: Mobile Platform Foundation Implementation

## Parent Epic

**Epic 1.5: Development Environment Foundation - Brownfield Enhancement** - This story focuses on transforming the placeholder App.tsx into a real navigation structure with screens architecture, implementing stealth mode foundation for cultural adaptation, and establishing cross-platform component integration following UX Architecture patterns.

## Status

**Done**
