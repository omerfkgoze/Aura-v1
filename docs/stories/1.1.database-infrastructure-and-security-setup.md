## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context

This story implements the foundational database infrastructure as specified in the tech stack and backend architecture documents, establishing secure PostgreSQL database with comprehensive RLS policies before any application logic implementation.

### Previous Story Insights

From Story 0.10 completion (Security Gates Framework Implementation):

- **Security Gate Framework**: Established comprehensive security validation that this database setup must pass
- **RLS Policy Testing**: Security gates include automated RLS testing that validates user isolation
- **Crypto Envelope Validation**: Database schema must support CryptoEnvelope structure for all encrypted data
- **PII Prevention Gates**: Database design must prevent any plaintext health data storage

Key Integration Points:

- Database schema must pass security gate validation for RLS enforcement
- All encrypted tables must support CryptoEnvelope standardized structure
- Database migrations must integrate with security gate validation pipeline
- RLS policies must prevent cross-user access as validated by security gates

### Technology Stack Integration [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

**Database Technology Requirements:**

**Primary Database:** PostgreSQL (Supabase) 15+ for managed database with Row Level Security
**Infrastructure as Code:** Supabase CLI + SQL Migrations for reproducible database schema
**Authentication Integration:** Supabase Auth + WebAuthn for Passkeys authentication
**Monitoring:** Sentry (privacy-safe) for error tracking without PII exposure

**Key Integration Requirements:**

- Database must integrate with Supabase Auth for RLS policy enforcement using `auth.uid()`
- Migration system must support versioned RLS policies with staging/production parity
- Connection pooling must handle expected load from Next.js API routes
- SSL/TLS enforcement must integrate with Vercel deployment security

### Data Models Integration [Source: architecture/data-models.md]

**Core Database Schema Requirements:**

**User Table (Minimal Metadata):**

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
  id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  created_at timestamp with time zone DEFAULT now(),
  last_active_at timestamp with time zone DEFAULT now()
);
```

**EncryptedUserPrefs Table:**

```sql
CREATE TABLE encrypted_user_prefs (
  id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id uuid REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  encrypted_payload text NOT NULL,
  crypto_envelope jsonb NOT NULL,
  version integer NOT NULL DEFAULT 1,
  device_id text NOT NULL,
  synced_at timestamp with time zone DEFAULT now(),
  created_at timestamp with time zone DEFAULT now(),
  updated_at timestamp with time zone DEFAULT now()
);
```

**EncryptedCycleData Table (Enhanced with Sync Support):**

```sql
CREATE TABLE encrypted_cycle_data (
  id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id uuid REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  encrypted_payload text NOT NULL,
  crypto_envelope jsonb NOT NULL,
  version integer NOT NULL DEFAULT 1,
  device_id text NOT NULL,
  local_timestamp timestamp with time zone NOT NULL,
  synced_at timestamp with time zone DEFAULT now(),
  sync_status text DEFAULT 'synced' CHECK (sync_status IN ('pending', 'synced', 'conflict')),
  created_at timestamp with time zone DEFAULT now(),
  updated_at timestamp with time zone DEFAULT now()
);
```

**HealthcareShare Table:**

```sql
CREATE TABLE healthcare_share (
  id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id uuid REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  encrypted_share_data text NOT NULL,
  crypto_envelope jsonb NOT NULL,
  share_token text UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  status text DEFAULT 'active' CHECK (status IN ('active', 'expired', 'revoked')),
  expires_at timestamp with time zone NOT NULL,
  access_count integer DEFAULT 0,
  last_accessed_at timestamp with time zone,
  device_type text CHECK (device_type IN ('mobile', 'desktop', 'unknown')),
  created_at timestamp with time zone DEFAULT now()
);
```

**ShareToken Table (Separate for RLS):**

```sql
CREATE TABLE share_token (
  token text PRIMARY KEY,
  share_id uuid REFERENCES healthcare_share(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  expires_at timestamp with time zone NOT NULL
);
```

**DeviceKey Table (Secure Key Management):**

```sql
CREATE TABLE device_key (
  id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id uuid REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  device_id_hash text NOT NULL,
  encrypted_master_key text NOT NULL,
  key_derivation_path text NOT NULL,
  key_version integer NOT NULL DEFAULT 1,
  next_rotation_at timestamp with time zone NOT NULL,
  status text DEFAULT 'active' CHECK (status IN ('active', 'revoked', 'suspended')),
  platform text CHECK (platform IN ('ios', 'android', 'web')),
  app_version text,
  last_active_at timestamp with time zone DEFAULT now(),
  created_at timestamp with time zone DEFAULT now()
);
```

### Backend Architecture Integration [Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md]

**Database Access Layer Requirements:**

**Repository Pattern with RLS Enforcement:**

- All database access must use RLS-enforced repository patterns
- Service accounts must have minimal privilege access patterns
- Optimistic concurrency must be implemented for all data mutations
- RPC functions must be used for complex operations requiring transaction safety

**Required RPC Functions:**

- `update_cycle_data_optimistic`: Handles concurrent updates with version conflict detection
- `validate_share_token`: Secure token validation for healthcare sharing
- `healthcare_access_audit`: Privacy-safe logging of healthcare sharing activities

### Project Structure Alignment [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]
