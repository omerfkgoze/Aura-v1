## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Context

No specific previous story context required - this is foundational development environment setup.

### Tech Stack Integration

- **Mobile Framework**: Expo/React Native 50.x provides cross-platform development with Metro bundler [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Web Framework**: Next.js 14.x with SSR disabled for PII protection, using Vite bundler [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **UI Components**: Tamagui for unified cross-platform design system across web and mobile [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Build Tool**: Nx 17.x for monorepo orchestration with build caching and dependency management [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Bundlers**: Vite for web builds, Metro for mobile builds - platform-optimized [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]

### Project Structure Alignment

- **Mobile App**: `apps/mobile/src/` contains React Native application requiring proper Metro configuration [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md]
- **Web App**: `apps/web/src/` contains Next.js application with API routes requiring Vite configuration [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md]
- **Shared UI**: `libs/ui/src/` contains Tamagui components that must work on both platforms [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md]
- **Shared Types**: `libs/shared-types/src/` contains TypeScript definitions requiring proper path resolution [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md]
- **Crypto Core**: `libs/crypto-core/` contains Rust/WASM bindings requiring special bundler configuration [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md]

### Configuration Requirements

- **Nx Workspace**: Development servers must integrate with Nx workspace configuration and build caching [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md]
- **TypeScript**: All development servers must support TypeScript 5.3+ with strict mode and proper path mapping [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Environment Variables**: Development setup must access config through config objects, never process.env directly [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md]
- **Package Resolution**: Monorepo packages must resolve correctly using workspace configuration [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md]

### Development Standards

- **Hot Reload**: Both platforms must support real-time code changes during development
- **Shared Components**: Tamagui components must render correctly on both web and mobile platforms
- **Error Handling**: Development servers must provide proper error reporting and debugging capabilities
- **Build Performance**: Development setup should leverage Nx build caching for optimal performance

### Testing

#### Test File Locations

No specific guidance found in architecture docs for test file locations in this context.

#### Test Standards

- **Frontend Testing**: Vitest + Testing Library for fast unit/integration tests with Vite-native support [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **E2E Testing**: Playwright for cross-platform E2E testing with reliable mobile support [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]

#### Testing Frameworks and Patterns

- **Development Testing**: Verify development servers start correctly and display existing components
- **Hot Reload Testing**: Test real-time code changes work on both platforms
- **Package Resolution Testing**: Verify shared packages load correctly in development mode
- **Integration Testing**: Test Nx workspace integration with development workflow

#### Specific Testing Requirements

- **Mobile Development**: Test `npx expo start` launches correctly and displays components
- **Web Development**: Test Next.js dev server starts and shows pages/components
- **Monorepo Testing**: Test shared package resolution and TypeScript path mapping
- **Build Regression**: Verify production builds continue to work after development setup changes

## Dev Agent Record

### Agent Model Used

Claude Sonnet 4 (claude-sonnet-4-20250514)

### Debug Log References

- Metro bundler configuration: apps/mobile/metro.config.js
- Next.js project configuration: apps/web/project.json
- Root package.json development scripts
- TypeScript path mapping: tsconfig.base.json

### Completion Notes

Successfully resolved critical development server issues and configured both mobile and web applications:

**Issues Resolved:**

1. **Mobile "main" Registration Error**: Fixed Expo entry point by creating proper index.js with AppRegistry.registerComponent
2. **Web Compilation Hanging**: Simplified Next.js configuration, corrected package names (@aura/shared-types), removed complex webpack config
3. **Metro Bundler Monorepo Integration**: Validated existing Metro configuration for shared package resolution
4. **Watchman Recrawl Issues**: Fixed file watching problems causing development server instability

**Configuration Updates:**

1. **Expo Mobile Development**: Created index.js entry point, updated package.json main field, validated Metro bundler monorepo support
2. **Next.js Web Development**: Streamlined next.config.js, fixed transpilePackages configuration, removed problematic webpack customizations
3. **Shared Package Resolution**: Verified libs/ directory structure and @aura/ namespace package resolution
4. **Cross-platform Testing**: Confirmed both development servers start successfully (mobile: port 8082, web: port 3001)

**Test Results:**

- ✅ Mobile Development Server: Starts without "main" registration errors
- ✅ Web Development Server: Compiles quickly without hanging (1.25s startup)
- ✅ Package Resolution: All @aura/\* packages resolve correctly
- ✅ Hot Reload: Both platforms support real-time code changes

All acceptance criteria met with proper error handling and debugging support.

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-18

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

Excellent implementation quality. Development server configuration has been properly implemented with good Metro bundler configuration for mobile and fixed Nx executor for web. Shared package resolution is correctly configured with appropriate aliases and path mapping.

### Refactoring Performed

No refactoring was necessary during this review. The code quality is already high and follows project standards.

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ Configuration files follow proper module.exports pattern and use appropriate require() statements
- Project Structure: ✓ Changes align with documented monorepo structure and Nx workspace patterns
- Testing Strategy: ⚠️ Development server functionality tested manually, but automated infrastructure tests could be added
- All ACs Met: ✓ All acceptance criteria have been implemented and verified

### Improvements Checklist

- [x] Metro configuration supports monorepo shared packages with proper aliases
- [x] Next.js development server uses correct Nx executor configuration
- [x] Concurrent development scripts work correctly for both platforms
- [x] Manual testing verified development servers start and display components
- [ ] Consider adding automated tests for development server startup/configuration validation
- [ ] Consider documenting troubleshooting for common Metro/Next.js development issues

### Security Review

No security concerns identified. Configuration changes are limited to development environment setup and do not affect production builds or expose sensitive data.

### Performance Considerations

Good performance configuration with:

- Nx build caching integration maintained
- Proper workspace root watching in Metro config
- Concurrent execution support for multiple development servers
- No performance degradation identified in testing

### Files Modified During Review

No files were modified during review. All implementation was already complete and meets standards.
